## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ 
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gearguard.git
cd gearguard
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables**
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
```
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

4. **Initialize the database**
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

5. **Start the development server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## 🚀 Getting Started

### First Time Setup

1. **Open the application**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Create an account**: Click on the signup link
3. **Fill in registration details**:
   - Full Name
   - Email
   - Password (will be hashed with bcryptjs)
4. **Login**: Use your credentials to access the dashboard

### ⚠️ Important: Session Reset on Server Restart

**Every time you restart the server (`npm run dev`), all users will be automatically logged out.**

- The application clears the session on each startup
- Users must **login again** with their credentials
- This is intentional for development/security purposes
- To test fresh login flow: Just restart the server with `npm run dev`

### Test Credentials

**Pre-created test account:**
- **Email**: `test@example.com`
- **Password**: `Test@123456`
- **Display Name**: `Test User`

Use these credentials to login after every server restart.
